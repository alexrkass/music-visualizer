This is an attempt to clone [a sound reactive visualizer](http://airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/reactive/) that I found while researching Web Audio API and Three.js.

In its current form it renders a tiny gray circle and plays the music while the circle sits there and does nothing. Kinda meh.

I wrote it in Literate Coffeescript which gives me loads of street cred (although I haven't written docs for it yet so that doesn't really add any value...)

Check out the module pattern I used in loop-visualizer.js; it's not perfect in terms of separation of concerns and I tried to cut some corners by making some global variables but it's a pretty good try, I think.
